The computer font Savings Bond was created by 
Harold Lohner, 1998, and placed into the public 
domain by him.

Savings Bond was created in need from my recollection
of such a font.  It turned out to resemble Futura 
Display or Function Display.

Use your Character Map utility to locate alternate g and
y forms.

Let me know what you do with this!
